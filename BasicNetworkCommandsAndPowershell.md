# Using netstat and powershell on windows to learn more about what processes are communicating with the outside world.

## How to check what ports are open?
QUESTION: What is the different between NMAP and netstat?  
QUESTION: What is your local address? What does it represent?  
Open a command line prompt. Type `netstat`  
What IP address are they communicating with?  
What port are they communicating with?  
What protocol it is using?  

## How to know what processes are opening those ports?

To get the PID number you can use the following flag with the netstat command:  
`netstat -o`  
The -o command provided the PID.  

## How to get more info about those processes?
Using the windows powershell.  


Using command line  

You can use tasklist to get a list of running processes `tasklist`  
If you want to narrow your search by the PID you can use  
`tasklist /fi "pid eq processId"`  
Check out where I got my info regarding tasklist and to read more: [link](https://www.windows-commandline.com/tasklist-command/)


Once you have the name of the process you can get the exe file path and other info with the following command commands:  
To get more info about a process using image name:  
`tasklist /FI "ImageName eq Spring.Tests.exe" /v /fo List`  

To get where the executable is located:  
`wmic process where "name='mysqld.exe'" get ProcessID, ExecutablePath`
